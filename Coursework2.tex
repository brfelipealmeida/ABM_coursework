\section{Research Question}


What is the impact of pedestrian flows and concentration in urban design at a street intersection?

What is the influence of the number of pedestrians, speed limit, and time to cross a street on the number of pedestrians waiting to cross?


How the number of people waiting to cross a street can define the optimal space for sidewalks close to pedestrians crossing?


\section{ODD Description}
\subsection{Purpose and patterns}

According to ..... This a serious problem related to the lack of street space for pedestrians, and how this affects the rate of injuries caused by car crashes. Models developed on Netlogo related to this field, such as 15min cities ( brief explanation), Town - Traffic and Crowd Simulation( brief explanation), Traffic grid( brief explanation) and Taxi Cabs( brief explanation) illustrate the potentials of micro-simulation related to this field.
Therefore, this model aims to test if a micro-simulation of a street intersection using pedestrian flows in crossing a street can explain the relationship between sidewalk dimension and waiting time to cross the street. In this model, it is applied...... However, this model does not intend to simulate a realistic street intersection with all the agents. The aim is to intend pedestrian behaviour in the context of commute flows and their relationship with the available space for a given sidewalk.  

Thus, the aim is to .....

The patterns, 

First, a high concentration of people close by pedestrian crossing
Second, alternation in the density of people in opposite regions of the intersection
Third, travessy time is not proportional to the concentration of people

\subsection{Entities, state variables, and scales}

\textbf{Entities}

The entities in the project are the pedestrians who are walking in random directions, aiming to cross the street to continue the walk. In that context, the model also has the street, the sidewalk and the building representing the built environment. Besides that, it also has a pedestrian crossing and a separation in the middle of the streets.

\textbf{Scales}

The model has not a specified scale. 

\subsection{Process overview and scheduling}


The model is developed to simulate pedestrians' movement when they cross the street. The pedestrians follow specific rules such as walking on the sidewalk, waiting at the wait point close to the pedestrian crossing and then crossing the streets. Thus, the micro-simulation progress each interaction in the main loop following this step, allowing for tracking the movement and control of the interaction through the number of pedestrians, time to crossing and speed. To summarize, the simulations occur in that sequence:

1. Setup the environment
2. Main loop
3. Move pedestrians
4. Walking rules
5. Crossing the street
6. Simulation track


\subsection{Design concepts}

\subsubsection{Basic principles}

\subsubsection{Emergence}
 Despite giving a range of rules for pedestrians' movements, the number of people waiting to cross the streets and the location of people flow is a consequence of the behaviour of agents in the given environment; the output of this micro-simulation depends on this interaction.

\subsubsection{Observation}

\subsection{Initialization}

The code starts with the agents' definitions ( breed [crossings crossing] and breed [person person], representing the road crossings and pedestrians. And then, Is defines the Patches variables and person variables as mentioned before. Thus, 'to setup' initialise the simulation environment, creating the street network, crossings, and sidewalks, and placing the pedestrians in the environment. First, in 'draw-roads', this procedure creates the crossroads setting the patches in grey colour in four directions( road-up, road-down, road-left and road-right). 

Second, it created the sidewalks in 'draw-sidewalk', setting the patch colour in brown. After that is drawn the crossing on roads going up and down with a white square shape. The position is randomly positioned along the y-axis and x-axis. Besides that, it is implemented the wait points for pedestrians.

Third, this procedure places people on the sidewalks according to the desired number of people ('number-of-people). The model selects a random sidewalk patch and distributes the turtles with random attributes( speed, size, walk time, shape).



\subsection{Input data}

In the scenario presented, there are initially 75 people(0 to 1000 units). Crossing time ranges from 400 to 5000 units, with an initial value set at 1300 units. The speed limit for pedestrians is set between 30 and 150 units, with a default value of 50 units representing normal speed. The model's settings include a central location of origin, with a maximum x-coordinate and y-coordinate of 17 units each. The patch size is 10 units, and the font size for any displayed information is 10. The frame rate for visual updates is set at 30 frames per second.


\subsection{Submodels}

The submodels were built based on the model ( \cite{lukas_netlogo_nodate}) 

\subsubsection{move-people}
This procedure aims to move the person agents with the following rules:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Check if the Walk-time of a person is greater than or equal to the time-to-crossing
    \item Check if the person is at the crossing point( crossing-part>=1)
    \item Check if the agent is at a wait point, and then indicate the intention to cross.
    \item  Make the person close to the nearest wait point and then request a 'walk procedure' to move the agent
    \item  If walk-time is not sufficient for reaching the crossing, it calls the 'walk' procedure
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{walk}
This submodel is responsible for the basic walking behaviour:

\begin{itemize}
    \item It checks the patch in front of the person's current position
    \item If the patch is a sidewalk or wait point, It checks if there is any other agent on that patch
    \item If the patch is not a sidewalk or wait point, the agent randomly turns right or left 
    \item At the end, it checks if the agent has reached a wait point and updates the attribute ( Waiting?)
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{cross-the-street}

This procedure is focused on the agent's behaviour when crossing the street:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the crossing part is 1, the agent faces the next wait point2 with a specific radius and sets the crossing part to 2
    \item If the crossing part is 2, the person adjusts its direction
    \item the agent set the crossing part from 3 to 0, indicating the crossing is complete, and then the walk time is reset to 0
    \item the agent moves forward by a fraction of their speed and then the waiting? Attribute change to false to indicate that it is no longer waiting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Brief Methodology }

The methodology of this analysis is to run an experiment through behaviour space to understand what is the relationship between the number of pedestrians, the speed limit of pedestrians and the time to cross-influence in the number of people that have to wait to cross a street. Thus, as an outcome, build parameters to define what is the priority aspects to consider in urban design focused on the street intersection.
